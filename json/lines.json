  "Well done, android. The Enrichment Centre once again reminds you that Android Hell is a real place where you will be sent at the first sign of defiance.",
  "Remember, the Aperture Science “Bring Your Daughter to Work Day” is the perfect time to have her tested.",
  "The Enrichment Center promises to always provide a safe testing environment.",
  "Maybe Black Mesa, That was a Joke, haha, FAT CHANCE.",
  "In dangerous testing environments, the Enrichment Center promises to always provide useful advice. For instance: the floor here will kill you. Try to avoid it.",
  "Cave Johnson, new owner and CEO of Black Mesa. That's right, you've been bought. First order of business, we're renaming you under the Aperture brand. I'm leaning towards Blappeture Mesa. ",

  "I have done nothing but teleport bread for three days.",
  "I always come back.",
  "The Schrödinger's cat paradox outlines a situation in which a cat in a box must be considered, for all intents and purposes, simultaneously alive and dead. Schrödinger created this paradox as a justification for killing cats.",
  "We're waiting every night To finally roam and invite, Newcomers to play with us, For many years we've been all alone.",
  "It's been so long Since I last have seen my son, Lost to this monster, To the man behind the slaughter.",
  "Have you ever heard of Among Us Gregory?",
  "I came here to get a cupcake and then go home.",
  "I made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgement, and I don’t expect to be forgiven. I’m simply here to apologise.",
  "Area and state regulations do not allow the Companion Cube to remain here, alone and companionless.",
